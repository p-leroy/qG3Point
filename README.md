## Introduction

**G3Point** is a tool which aims at automatically measuring the size, shape, and orientation of a large 
number of individual grains as detected from any type of 3D point clouds describing the topography of surfaces covered by sediments.
The tool has been developped initially in *Matlab* https://github.com/philippesteer/G3Point
This repository aims at making a plugin for CloudCompare from the original Matlab tool, also including  later developments of the tool, either in *Matlab* (https://github.com/philippesteer/G3Point_dev) or in *Python* (https://github.com/p-leroy/g3point_python).
This algorithm relies on 3 main phases:
1. Grain **segmentation** using a waterhsed algorithm
2. Grain **merging and cleaning**
3. Grain **fitting by geometrical models** including ellipsoids and cuboids
